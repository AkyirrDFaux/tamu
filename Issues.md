# Issues

Open items only. Resolved findings, the 2026-10-04 per-area audits and the doc-fact-check rulings
that were applied are in the git history.

Item codes: **B** = code-fix items (the 2026-10-09 fact check); **E** = the remaining open backlog items, numbered for later handling. Closed on 2026-10-15 and removed: **B11** (BLE large-reply drain fixed), **E12** (storage hooks converted to a class), **E19** (structurally requester-only), **E24** (Register string clamp documented), **E28** (no capability bit needed), **E4** (obsolete, replaced), **E22** (not needed), **E23** (fixed).

## B. Code fixes still open (the document is the specification)

**B27 Script-file length validation wraps in uint32.** *(WITHDRAWN 2026-10-14 by the owner: a script file cannot approach the 32-bit limit, so the wrap is not reachable. The `474489e` change was reverted. Kept for the record - the sweep's other arithmetic findings were checked and stand.)* `ScriptProgram.h:209-217` summed four header-supplied uint32 lengths, so a crafted `SCR_XXX` header passed `Need > Size` with the running offsets ~4 GB past the buffer.

**B1 Router and branch broadcast are documented and unimplemented.** - **scope settled**: after the beta. The rig has no multi-bus device to test a tree topology on. `RSBus and Packets.md:3-7` and
`Data Formats.md:37` (`0x3FE`) describe a router tree; `Dispatcher.h:36-40` says the multi-bus topology
is not implemented and `Docs/Services/Router.md` is a stub.

**B5 System block field 8.1 has no code.** `System Block...md:24` documents `WiFi connection
information` at 8.1; there is no WiFi code in the firmware.

**B6 The UDP framing has no code.** `App Interface.md:25-27` documents a UDP packet; the firmware
implements USB and BLE only.

## D. Unverifiable from code

`RSBus and Packets.md:1` supply voltage and USB PD (hardware), `Data Formats.md:7` "14 byte UUID"
(14 bytes confirmed, UUID loose), `Data Formats.md:53` the generic dictionary marker encoding,
`Register.md:34` the Internal/External Access columns, `Register.md:48` "sorting by the whole uint32",
`Storage.md:86-96` the dynamic block descriptor ordering (runtime only), and the Valu feature rows that
are hardware-only.

## Open (2026-10-06)

- **E25** **The Valu bootloader can only ever be replaced over the ROM bootloader.** Our own bootloader
  refuses writes below `APP_BASE` by design, and this board has no SWD header, so every bootloader
  iteration needs an ISP session (`wchisp-nightly`, one command per USB reset). Worth keeping in
  mind when deciding how much logic belongs in the bootloader rather than the app.
- **E26** **`valu_upload.py` drives `wlink` over SWD, which this board cannot do.** The ISP recipe that
  actually works (USB port reset, then a single `wchisp-nightly` invocation) needs folding into it
  as an `--isp` mode so `./upload.sh boot valu` matches reality.
- **E30** **DAS_v0_1 is 308 B over the beta-window flash gate, and the documented headroom is stale.**
  Clean rebuilds (2026-10-17, `3e6f505`): `RAM 100.0% (2048/2048)` / `Flash 95.9% (13748/14336)`; at
  `fc964e5` (2026-10-13) `RAM 99.0% (2028)` / `Flash 93.9% (13464)`. So `.text` grew 13160 -> 13444
  (+284 B) and statics +20 B across the 2026-10-13..2026-10-15 storage/discovery/subscription work.
  The beta gate `TODO.md:165` ("DAS <= 2028 B RAM, <= 13440 B flash", written 2026-10-11) is breached
  on both counts, and the "~94 % flash / ~99 % RAM" figures in `TODO.md:176` and `AGENTS.md` no longer
  match the code. The 100 % RAM figure is by design - statics (1048 B) + stack (1000 B) fill the 2 KB
  exactly, the state `firmware/platformio.ini` documents and the linker guards - so the 2028 B gate
  cannot be met without cutting a static. **Decision needed (owner):** move the gate to the measured
  reality, or keep 13440 B and trim >= 308 B of DAS flash. Tracked as kanban `t_2143e21b`. Size lines
  are only trustworthy after `pio run -e DAS_v0_1 -t clean` - a stale `.pio/build/DAS_v0_1` can still
  report "up to date".

## Valu v2.0 app (2026-10-06) - parked (owner: not now)

- **E27** **Resistive measurement reference resistor is undefined.** `Docs/Devices.md` gives three ADC
  inputs (PA6/PA1/PA0) but says "Reference resistor not defined." With no reference and no range
  selectors, the resistance/LDR/NTC transforms in `Devices/Valu_v2.0/MeasuringRun.h` use a
  placeholder `VALU_MEAS_REF_KOHM` (10 kOhm); raw and voltage measurements do not depend on it.
  Needs a hardware value before a resistance-reading module is meaningful.
- **Valu LED displays are registered; OLED still TODO.** `Docs/Devices.md` lists "LED Display x2"
  and "OLED Display (TODO)" for the Valu. The two LED-display instances are now registered in
  `Devices/Valu_v2.0/Main.h` (the generic Vysi1 block; the strip geometry comes from the layout
  file at runtime). The OLED module is still not built.
- **E29** **`MAX_SCRIPTS` is reduced to 16 on the Valu.** The Script service's loaded-script registry is
  `LoadedScript scriptRegistry[256]` (~38 KB) in `ScriptDefs.h`; the CH32V203's 20 KB cannot hold
  it, so the registry is now a `#ifndef`-guarded build knob and the Valu sets `-D MAX_SCRIPTS=16`.
  Higher Scripts-range indices report as unloaded. **Update 2026-10-11:** the mask word count is now
  `(MAX_SCRIPTS + 63) / 64`, so the Valu's 16 slots get one mask word (it was 0 - an out-of-bounds write
  that also left the script tick path uncompiled); restoring that path costs the Valu ~9 KB flash
  (32 788 -> 42 176, 93.6%), parked.

## Docs decisions needed (parked unless noted)

- **E1** **OS notifications.** `Docs/App/Settings.md` lists "Allow notifications (To OS)" with per-event
  selection; the app persists `notifyOs`/`osEvents`/`suppressOsWhenOpen` but only delivers in-app
  notifications (`app/lib/core/notifications.dart`). **Parked (owner: not now)** - implement OS
  delivery or mark the setting pending.
- **E6** **Dynamic descriptor doc omits `Name`/`generation`/`present`.** The `DynamicBlockDescriptor`
  (`MemoryBlocks.h:35-49`) has `char Name[`BLOCK_NAME_LEN`]`, `uint32_t generation` and `bool present`
  beyond the documented pointers and sizes (`Register.md:88-98`). **Under review** (owner wants a
  closer look).

## Android (on-device behaviour untested)

- **E20** No Android device/emulator: BLE runtime permission prompt + denied/permanently-denied paths, BLE
  scan/connect/MTU, Storage Access Framework backup save + restore and file download, and the
  compact drawer shell on a phone form factor. The app's **update flow end to end** is the other
  Android item, and it gates the beta criteria in `TODO.md`. **Owner directed: look for improvements.**
