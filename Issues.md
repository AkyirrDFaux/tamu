# Issues

## Naming/coverage gaps vs the docs (decision needed)
- **Script file names.** `Docs/Services/Script.md` says `SCR_XXX`; the implementation uses
  `SCR_XX` (`SCR_00..SCR_3F`, 64 slots) in both firmware (`Core/Services/Script.h`) and app
  (`app/lib/core/script_file.dart`). Rename if >64 scripts are wanted.
- **Script management CID 8.** The firmware adds CID 8 "Read error" (`Script.h`); the docs
  table stops at CID 7. Document the extension or fold the error code into CID 5.
- **OS notifications.** `Docs/App/Settings.md` lists "Allow notifications (To OS)" with
  per-event selection; the app persists `notifyOs`/`osEvents`/`suppressOsWhenOpen` but only
  delivers in-app notifications (`app/lib/core/notifications.dart`). Implement OS delivery
  or mark the settings as pending.
- **Script UI info carries no enum labels in the docs.** `Docs/Services/Script.md` describes the
  UI info as names plus per-input limits/UI type; the app now writes **version 2** with a label
  list per input (the custom-enum / dropdown case). **v1 is no longer supported** (the app's
  parser and the firmware's function-name read accept version 2 only), so an old backup's script
  names fall back to the file name until re-saved - the format should be documented.
- **`Docs/Current setup v3.md` predates the emote interface.** The implementation adds script 2
  outputs (pupil offset L/R), script 3 inputs 2/3 (Force close / Max opening) and script 5
  (Emote selector) with a custom-enum emote input; the spec still lists only script 2's two
  inputs and no script 5 interface.
- **Position matrices carry a pre-rotated translation.** The renderer samples the geometry and
  texture masks *forward*, so a shape's centre lands at `-L^-1 * t`; with a rotation baked into
  the Position the shape would drift. Both writers (`ScriptExecTransform` and the app's
  `Transform23`) therefore store `t' = L * t`, which keeps the centre at `-t` for any rotation
  (an unrotated transform is unchanged). `Docs/Modules and blocks/LED display.md` describes
  Position as a plain 2x3 matrix, so a hand-written rotated matrix would need to know this.
- **Cross-script macro calls: the encoding and the waiting semantics are unspecified.**
  `Docs/Services/Script.md` lists "Macro call" and "Script (un)loading" in the functions table
  and nothing else - no opcode, no symbol encoding, no statement about what happens when the
  *callee* blocks. The (un)loading half is implemented (service ops 7/8, mirroring management
  CIDs 1/2, with a self-(un)load guard). The macro-call half needs a decision before it can be
  built, because the VM runs **one script per tick** and every wait state (`waitUntil`,
  `pendingForeign`, the 500 ms foreign deadline) lives on the callee:
  - if a callee waits on a foreign register reply, the tick loop must resume the *callee*, not
    the caller - so one script's state can no longer describe the run;
  - `Return` must know which script and line to come back to, i.e. the call stack has to carry
    a script slot as well as an instruction index;
  - it is not stated whether a macro call is blocking (caller waits for the callee to finish) or
    immediate, nor whether arguments/results cross the boundary, nor how recursion depth is
    counted (`SCRIPT_MAX_CALL_DEPTH` is per script today).
  Proposal to confirm: a `Call script` flow op with operands `(loaded script id, entry line)`,
  blocking by construction (the caller's instruction pointer stays on the call line and it
  resumes only on the callee's `Return`/`Halt`), a shared call stack of `(script, line)` pairs,
  and no argument passing (scripts exchange values through registers, as they already do).

## Register active flags (docs gap)
- **"Subscription Source" has no wire bit.** `Docs/Services/Register.md` lists four active flags
  as a 4-bit segment per static entry (Not Saved, Script Updated, Subscription Source, External
  origin), and says a read "combines the active and passive flags together". But the flags field
  is only 6 bits (bits 10-15, `BLOCK_META_FLAGS_MASK`): ReadOnly/Persistent/Trigger plus Not
  Saved/Script Updated/External origin already fill it, so the fourth active flag cannot be
  reported. Not Saved, Script Updated and External origin are implemented (set/cleared as write
  provenance - see `TODO.md` A1/D2); Subscription Source is left unimplemented rather than stored
  unreportably. Either the docs drop it or the flags field needs another bit.
- **`Docs/Services/Register.md` should state the array's size rule the implementation uses.**
  The doc gives `4 bits * number of all individual static entries`; the implementation adds the
  System block's fields to that count (the section title implies it, but the formula does not say
  so explicitly) and sizes the array per board via a build flag.

## Android (on-device behaviour untested)

- **On-device behavior not yet verified** (no Android device/emulator configured): the BLE
  runtime permission prompt and its denied/permanently-denied paths, BLE scan/connect/MTU,
  the Storage Access Framework backup save + restore and file download, and the compact
  drawer shell on a phone form factor.

## Evaluation setup (`Docs/Current setup v3.md`)
- **LED brightness can brown out the board.** The LED-display driver accepts brightness
  values whose current draw resets the MCU (the board dropped off USB at 60 %; a stored
  brightness script at a high ceiling put it in a boot/brown-out loop). The builder clamps the
  displays to 5 % before anything else, and the brightness script's ceiling is 70 % (reached
  around 10k lux). A firmware-side current cap (or a ramp) would be safer than relying on the app.
- **The LED display has no framebuffer readback.** `Docs/Modules and blocks/LED display.md`
  exposes no way to read the rendered pixels, so a HIL test can only assert the render
  dictionary contents + the refresh rate. The `Cut` mask operation is exercised by the LED
  probe (`hil_led_display_test`); the evaluation scene uses only `Replace` now that dark mode
  is a filled iris, and the *look* is verified by eye only. A render snapshot command would
  make the visuals testable.
- **DAS provider subscriptions accumulate stale entries.** The DAS provider table holds 4, and
  a requester cancel does not always reach the DAS (busy bus / dropped packet), so stale
  providers linger and can block a new subscription (`ProviderFindFree` returns none). The
  setup builder clears both DAS provider tables first as a workaround. The fix is **parked
  pending documentation**: the cause is that the docs' "Transaction ID manager"
  (`Docs/RSBus and Packets.md` - REQACK plus a registered handler with a per-TRID timeout) is
  **not implemented**, so nothing ever confirms that a cancel landed. Scope and design are in
  `TODO.md`.
